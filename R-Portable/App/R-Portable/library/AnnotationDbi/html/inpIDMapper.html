<h2>Convenience functions for mapping IDs through an appropriate set of
annotation packages</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These are a set of convenience functions that attempt to take a list
of IDs along with some addional information about what those IDs are,
what type of ID you would like them to be, as well as some information
about what species they are from and what species you would like them
to be from and then attempts to the simplest possible conversion using
the organism and possible inparanoid annotation packages.  By default,
this function will drop ambiguous matches from the results.  Please
see the details section for more information about the parameters that
can affect this.  If a more complex treatment of how to handle
multiple matches is required, then it is likely that a less convenient
approach will be necessary.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
  inpIDMapper(ids, srcSpecies, destSpecies, srcIDType="UNIPROT",
  destIDType="EG", keepMultGeneMatches=FALSE, keepMultProtMatches=FALSE,
  keepMultDestIDMatches = TRUE)

  intraIDMapper(ids, species, srcIDType="UNIPROT", destIDType="EG",
  keepMultGeneMatches=FALSE)

  idConverter(ids, srcSpecies, destSpecies, srcIDType="UNIPROT",
  destIDType="EG", keepMultGeneMatches=FALSE, keepMultProtMatches=FALSE,
  keepMultDestIDMatches = TRUE)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>ids</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list or vector of original IDs to match</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>srcSpecies</code></td>
<td>
<p>The original source species in in paranoid
format. In other words, the 3 letters of the genus followed by 2
letters of the species in all caps.  Ie. 'HOMSA' is for Homo sapiens etc.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>destSpecies</code></td>
<td>
<p>the destination species in inparanoid format</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>species</code></td>
<td>
<p>the species involved</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>srcIDType</code></td>
<td>
<p>The source ID type written exactly as it would be
used in a mapping name for an eg package.  So for example, 'UNIPROT'
is how the uniprot mappings are always written, so we keep that
convention here.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>destIDType</code></td>
<td>
<p>the destination ID, written the same way as you
would write the srcIDType. By default this is set to &quot;EG&quot; for entrez
gene IDs</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>keepMultGeneMatches</code></td>
<td>
<p>Do you want to try and keep the 1st ID in
those ambiguous cases where more than one protein is suggested?  (You
probably want to filter them out - hence the default is FALSE)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>keepMultProtMatches</code></td>
<td>
<p>Do you want to try and keep the 1st ID in
those ambiguous cases where more than one protein is suggested?
(default = FALSE)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>keepMultDestIDMatches</code></td>
<td>
<p>If you have mapped to a destination ID OTHER
than an entrez gene ID, then it is possible that there may be multiple
answers.  Do you want to keep all of these or only return the 1st one?
(default = TRUE)</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

 
<p>inpIDMapper - This is a convenience function for getting an ID from one species
mapped to an ID type of your choice from another organism of your
choice.  The only mappings used to do this are the mappings that are
scored as 100 according to the inparanoid algorithm.  This function
automatically tries to join IDs by using FIVE different mappings in
the sequence that follows:
</p>
<p>1) initial IDs -&gt; src organism Entrez Gene IDs
2) src organism Entrez Gene IDs -&gt; sre organism Inparanoid ID
3) src organism Inparanoid ID -&gt; dest organism Inparanoid ID
4) dest organism Inparanoid ID -&gt; dest organism Entrez Gene ID
5) dest organism Entrez Gene ID -&gt; final destination organism ID
</p>
<p>You can simplify this mapping as a series of steps like this:
</p>
<p>srcIDs &mdash;&gt; srcEGs &mdash;&gt; srcInp &mdash;&gt; destInp &mdash;&gt; destEGs &mdash;&gt; destIDs
(1)         (2)         (3)          (4)          (5) 
</p>
<p>There are two steps in this process where multiple mappings can really
interfere with getting a clear answer.  It's no coincidence that these
are also adjacent to the two places where we have to tie the identity
to a single gene for each organism.  When this happens, any ambiguity
is confounding.  Preceding step \#2, it is critical that we only have
ONE entrez gene ID per initial ID, and the parameter
keepMultGeneMatches can be used to toggle whether to drop any
ambiguous matches (the default) or to keep the 1st one in the hope of
getting an additional hit.  A similar thing is done preceding step \#4,
where we have to be sure that the protein IDs we are getting back have
all mapped to only one gene.  We allow you to use the
keepMultProtMatches parameter to make the same kind of decision as in
step \#2, again, the default is to drop anything that is ambiguous.
</p>
<p>intraIDMapper - This is a convenience function to map within an
organism and so it has a much simpler job to do.  It will either map
through one mapping or two depending whether the source ID or
destination ID is a central ID for the relevant organism package.  If
the answer is neither, then two mappings will be needed.
</p>
<p>idConverter - This is mostly for convenient usage of these functions
by developers.  It is just a wrapper function that can pass along all
the parameters to the appropriate function (intraIDMapper or
inpIDMapper).  It decides which function to call based on the source
and destination organism.  The disadvantage to using this function all
the time is just that more of the parameters have to be filled out
each time.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a list where the names of each element are the elements of the
original list you passed in, and the values are the matching results.
Elements that do not have a match are not returned.  If you want
things to align you can do some bookeeping.
