<h2>Creates a simple Bimap from a SQLite database in an situation that
is external to AnnotationDbi</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function allows users to easily make a simple Bimap object for
extra tables etc that they may wish to add to their annotation
packages.  For most Bimaps, their definition is stored
inside of AnnotationDbi.  The addition of this function is to help
ensure that this does not become a limitation, by allowing simple
extra Bimaps to easily be defined external to AnnotationDbi.  Usually,
this will be done in the zzz.R source file of a package so that these
extra mappings can be seemlessly integrated with the rest of the
package.  For now, this function assumes that users will want to use
data from just one table.  
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
  createSimpleBimap(tablename, Lcolname, Rcolname, datacache, objName,
  objTarget)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>tablename</code></td>
<td>

<p>The name of the database table to grab the mapping information from. 
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>Lcolname</code></td>
<td>

<p>The field name from the database table.  These will become the Lkeys
in the final mapping.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>Rcolname</code></td>
<td>

<p>The field name from the database table.  These will become the Rkeys
in the final mapping.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>datacache</code></td>
<td>

<p>The datacache object should already exist for every standard
Annotation package.  It is not exported though, so you will have to
access it with ::: . It is needed to provide the connection
information to the function.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>objName</code></td>
<td>

<p>This is the name of the mapping.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>objTarget</code></td>
<td>

<p>This is the name of the thing the mapping goes with. For most uses,
this will mean the package name that the mapping belongs with.
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
##You simply have to call this function to create a new mapping.  For
##example, you could have created a mapping between the gene_name and
##the symbols fields from the gene_info table contained in the hgu95av2
##package by doing this:
library(hgu95av2.db)
hgu95av2NAMESYMBOL &lt;- createSimpleBimap("gene_info",
                                        "gene_name",
                                        "symbol",
                                        hgu95av2.db:::datacache,
                                        "NAMESYMBOL",
                                        "hgu95av2.db")
