<h2>Set Status of each Spot from List of Spot Types</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Determine the type (or status) of each spot in the gene list.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
controlStatus(types, genes, spottypecol="SpotType", regexpcol, verbose=TRUE)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>types</code></td>
<td>
<p>dataframe containing spot type specifiers, usually input using <code>readSpotTypes</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>genes</code></td>
<td>
<p>dataframe containing gene annotation, or an object of class <code>RGList</code>, <code>MAList</code>, <code>EListRaw</code>, <code>EList</code> or <code>MArrayLM</code> from which the gene annotation can be extracted.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>spottypecol</code></td>
<td>
<p>integer or name specifying column of <code>types</code> containing spot type names.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>regexpcol</code></td>
<td>
<p>vector of integers or column names specifying columns of types containing regular expressions.
Defaults to any column names in common between <code>types</code> and <code>genes</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical, if <code>TRUE</code> then progess on pattern matching is reported to the standard output channel.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function constructs a vector of status codes by searching for patterns in the gene list.
The data frame <code>genes</code> contains gene IDs and should have as many rows as there are spots on the microarrays.
Such a data frame is often read using <code><a href="readgal.html">readGAL</a></code>.
The data frame <code>types</code> has as many rows as you want to distinguish types of spots in the gene list.
This data frame should contain a column or columns, the <code>regexpcol</code> columns, which have the same names as columns in <code>genes</code> and which contain patterns to match in the gene list.
Another column, the <code>spottypecol</code>, contains the names of the spot types.
Any other columns are assumed to contain plotting parameters, such as colors or symbols, to be associated with the spot types.
</p>
<p>The patterns in the <code>regexpcol</code> columns are simplified regular expressions.
For example, <code>AA*</code> means any string starting with <code>AA</code>, <code>*AA</code> means any code ending with <code>AA</code>, <code>AA</code> means exactly these two letters, <code>*AA*</code> means any string containing <code>AA</code>, <code>AA.</code> means <code>AA</code> followed by exactly one other character and <code>AA\.</code> means exactly <code>AA</code> followed by a period and no other characters.
Any other regular expressions are allowed but the codes <code>^</code> for beginning of string and <code>$</code> for end of string should not be included.
</p>
<p>Note that the patterns are matched sequentially from first to last, so more general patterns should be included first.
For example, it is often a good idea to include a default spot-type as the first line in <code>types</code> with pattern <code>*</code> for all <code>regexpcol</code> columns and default plotting parameters.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Character vector specifying the type (or status) of each spot on the array.
Attributes contain plotting parameters associated with each spot type.
